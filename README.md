# CSCI353-Assignment2
Due to circumstances beyond our control, your final grade for pinger.py will be determined manually. However, we will still provide a test file for you to run your code. You will still have to use the special format as specified in 'Required Structure' in your Assignment2.pdf in order for the tests to work. 


# Using test Script
- Please be sure your pinger and pinger_test are situated in the same directory.  To run the tests, you need to ensure that pytest and ping3 is installed. You can do this by doing: 
- sudo pip (or pip3) install pytest
- sudo pip install ping3 
- In order to run the tests, you will need to run 'sudo pytest' in the directory. 


# Thank you for your understanding. Feel free to reach out to me (hailey@usc.edu) should you have any further questions.
